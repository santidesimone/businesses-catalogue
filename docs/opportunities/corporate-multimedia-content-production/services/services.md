companies in the corporate world are transitioning to a business model based on digital. this process is know as “digital transformation”.
 
more and more they are becoming "tech companies" regardless of the original industry the were born into. 

these companies need to build digital products and digital experiences, but they are hard to create and require many iterations of development. yet they fail because their product, services and IT environments are interrelated in a very complex way, which is hard to understand and therefore hard to change.

the amount of qualified people with leadership and technical skill that would be required to make this companies succeed, is far below the demand for this roles.

and the workers already employed in these organizations typically lack the set of skills required to make such a transformation. 

even if talented people it hired, complexity and challenges may be so big within the organization that it is common to see this talent quickly go away since the high demand of these job roles allows them to choose.

therefore companies struggle to find the talent, and to retain it. 

one of the ways these companies seek to mitigate this reality is by creating a strong company identity and culture and to communicate it both internally and externally, serving two primarily purposes: to attract talent, and to embrace it and hold it. communication plays a key role in  this. and the production of multimedia content is now more than ever an excellent means to communicate this company identity and help to build and grow the kind of culture that can make business succeed. 

the production of corporate videos for internal and external audiences can help leverage the communication strategy of the company. but tipically current efforts fail to solve efficiently one key problem: communicate with easy and simplicity complex matters. this is were we can help them and bring a solution.
